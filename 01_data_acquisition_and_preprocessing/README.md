# Epigenetic Aging Project: Step 1 – Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

This is the first step of my project to build an epigenetic clock. In this phase, I download, clean, and organize DNA methylation data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 

###  Dataset Overview
I am using data from four different studies as of now to look at how the human brain and blood age over a lifetime.

| Tissue | Source (GEO ID) | Samples (N) | Age Range |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brain** | GSE74193 | 335 | -0.5 to 75.6 years |
| **Blood** | GSE19711, GSE40279, GSE41037 | 1,322 | 16.0 to 101.0 years |
| **Total** | | **1,657** | |
