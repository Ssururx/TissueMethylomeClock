Tissue-specific epigenetic clocks trained on blood and brain methylation data, including feature discovery, model training, and performance evaluation.

This repository contains an ongoing computational epigenetics project focused on analyzing tissue-specific DNA methylation aging patterns in blood and brain. The workflow includes data quality control, feature discovery, epigenetic clock training with stability analysis, differential methylation region (DMR) clustering, gene annotation, genomic context analysis, and functional enrichment pipelines. The project is being developed iteratively in Google Colab, with this repository serving as a snapshot of the current methodology and analysis structure. Additional steps, including cell-type deconvolution, longitudinal modeling, and integration with external clinical and phenotypic datasets, are in progress.
